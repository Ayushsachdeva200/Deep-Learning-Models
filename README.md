Features:

Classification of waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories.
Utilizes deep learning models to achieve high accuracy.
Provides an intuitive interface for uploading and classifying images.
Technologies Used:

Python
TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Pandas
# Pollution Management System
Description:

This project focuses on predicting pollution levels based on air quality measurements and weather-related features. It provides insights and predictions to help manage and mitigate pollution using Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

Features:

Predicts pollution levels using machine learning models.
Analyzes air quality measurements and weather-related features.
Includes visualization of pollution data and predictions.
Technologies Used:

Python
Scikit-Learn
Pandas
Matplotlib
NumPy
Models Used:

Linear Regression: A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
